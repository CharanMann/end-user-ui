# Mirai (Selfservice) - UI

> This project is a redesign and technical rebuild of the existing Enduser UI at Forgerock.

## Development goals
1. Parity with the existing "Enduser" UI
2. Improved design
3. Improved developer experience
4. Better testing

### Setup assumptions
Currently Mirai is built off of two starting assumptions:
1. Reliance of IDM endpoints for managing "Enduser" with the eventual integration of platform features
2. The development environment is configured to hit a rest service located at localhost:8080 (the development server proxy can be configured at config/index)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080 (increments by 1 automatically if port is in use).
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```

## How to theme
1) Create a custom file in the scss folder. Use a name such as red-theme.scss. (For an example theme, see dart-theme.scss.)
2) To build with the custom theme, add --theme=red to your build command:

```
npm run dev --theme=red
or
npm run build --theme=red
```
3) Note: Theming relies on scss variable overrides. If you provide a css override to a variable, your build will include corresponding changes to ForgeRock / Bootstrap components.

## Translations
Currently translations work by making use of the info/uiconfig endpoint in IDM. The info/uiconfig endpoint returns the current browsers configured language.

Steps to use a new translation:
1) Configure your browser to the desired language (fr - french for this example)
2) Add new language with appropriate JSON key paths to translations/index

```
fr: {
    common: {
        notFound: 'Pas trouv√©'
    }
}
```

3) Language will by default fallback to en (english) for any missing JSON key path
