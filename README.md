# Mirai (Selfservice) - UI

> This project is a redesign and technical rebuild of the existing Enduser UI at Forgerock.

## Development goals
1. Parity with the existing "Enduser" UI
2. Improved design
3. Improved developer experience
4. Better testing

### Setup assumptions
Currently Mirai is built off of two starting assumptions:
1. Reliance of IDM endpoints for managing "Enduser" with the eventual integration of platform features
2. The development environment is configured to hit a rest service located at localhost:8080 (the development server proxy can be configured at config/index)
